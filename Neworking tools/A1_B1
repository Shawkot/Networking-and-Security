	Yes, it's possible for the packet loss percentage reported by mtr to be greater than 0 even if there is no loss in the transport layer traffic (TCP/UDP). This discrepancy can occur due to 			several reasons:ICMP Filtering: mtr uses ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) packets to measure latency and packet loss. Some routers or firewalls may filter or prioritize ICMP traffic 			differently from other types of traffic. This can lead to discrepancies in reported packet loss. Rate Limiting: Some routers may impose rate limiting or prioritize certain types of traffic, 			leading to packet loss for ICMP packets while allowing other traffic to pass without loss. Firewall Policies: Network devices or firewalls along the path may have specific policies for handling 	ICMP traffic, and this can affect the accuracy of the reported packet loss. ECMP and Load Balancing: Equal-Cost Multipath (ECMP) and load balancing techniques may route different packets on 			different paths. ICMP packets may follow one path, while transport layer traffic follows another, leading to differences in reported packet loss. In essence, the ICMP packets used by mtr may be 	treated differently by network devices compared to the actual transport layer traffic. Therefore, the reported packet loss percentage in mtr does not always directly reflect the packet loss   experienced by other types of traffic.
