In this repo, I uploaded all the solutions regarding "Laboratory works in Networking and Security." This is a master's level course and in this course, I did extensive lab works on the following topics:

- Installing and setting up Networking tools like nmap, traceroute, dig, ip, nc, mtr, etc. I also learned how  to set up vm by using vagrant file.
- Configuring web server like node.js, apache2, nginx and related configuration. Applying HTTPS, SSL, HSTS and other security related settings.
- Configuring email server by using different MDA (mail delivery agent) like postfix, exim4 and MTA (mail transfer agent) like procmail. Also, enabling spam filtering by uisng spamassassin.
- Configuration of DNS by using bind9. Creating caching only nameserver, primary and secondary (slave) nameserver, subdomain, tld server. For security, implementing tsig (transaction signature), pi-hole DNS sinkhole.
- Creating and congiruing IPv6 network, Ipv6 addressing.
- Filesystem encryption. Block encryption, file  encryption. Using tools like gpg, cryptosetup, gocryptfs, dm_crypt, veracrypt, truecrypt, LUKS (standard) etc.
- Network filesystem. Creating and configuring RAID filesystem, especially RAID level 5, mounting the filesystem, accessing over the network. Also, configuring NFS, SAMBA, SSHFS, WEBDAV, etc.
- Creating and applying firewall rules using packet filtering with nftables, implementing web proxy and DMZ.
- Implementing VPN
- Container
