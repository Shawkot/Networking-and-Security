# adding network or route
sudo ip route add fd01:2345:6789:abc1::/64 via fd01:2345:6789:abc2::1 dev enp0s8

# adding default route
sudo ip route add default via <GATEWAY_IP> dev <INTERFACE_NAME>

2.5 

# show routing table
ip route show
ip -6 route
ip address show dev enp0s8

In summary, this output indicates that the network interface has an IPv6 address (fd01:2345:6789:abc1::2) with a global scope, and this address is considered valid and preferred forever.

In IPv6 addressing, a double colon :: is used as a shorthand notation to represent consecutive groups of zeros within an IPv6 address. 

# tcpdump
sudo tcpdump --interface=any -c 20 -w ping6.pcap
sudo tcpdump -i enp0s8 -w file.pcap icmp6

# reading pcap file

        AdvOnLink on;

        AdvOnLink on;
        AdvAutonomous on;
        AdvRouterAddr on;
    };
};

# stopping an interface
sudo ip link set enp0s8 down

# installing and setting up router advertisement daemon
sudo apt-get install radvd
sudo nano /etc/radvd.conf
sudo systemctl start radvd
sudo systemctl enable radvd

# checking router advertisement (lab1)
sudo tcpdump -i enp0s8

sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.default.forwarding=1 &&
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.all.forwarding=1 &&
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv6.conf.enp0s3.accept_ra=0

3.1
prefix is mandatory

3.2
router solicitation and router advertisement

3.3
ans: EUI-64 (Extended Unique Identifier)
When a host receives the Router Advertisement with these settings, it can use the advertised prefix to generate its own IPv6 address. The process involves creating an Interface Identifier (IID) by either using the EUI-64 process (based on the MAC address) or randomly generating the IID.

For example, if a host has the MAC address 00:1a:2b:3c:4d:5e, the EUI-64 process would involve inserting fffe in the middle of the MAC address and inverting the seventh bit. The resulting IID would then be concatenated with the advertised prefix to form the host's IPv6 address.
